# CNN vs Traditional CV for Object Recognition

This project compares CNN-based and traditional computer vision algorithms (SIFT, Harris + SVM) on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets, analyzing the effects of image resolution and dataset size.

## Overview
- Task: Object recognition
- Methods: CNN (PyTorch), SIFT/Harris + BoVW + SVM (OpenCV, sklearn)
- Datasets: CIFAR-10 (low-res, large), STL-10 (high-res, small)

## Results
| Method              | CIFAR-10 | STL-10 |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| CNN (Best Model).   | 76.81%   | 67.47% |
| SIFT+SVM            | 37.02%   | 39.05% |
| Pretrained Resnet18 | 80.63%   | 85.21% |

## Model Development
- 15 CNN versions iterated to address overfitting
- Optimizer: RMSprop â†’ AdamW (+ weight decay)
- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
- Data Augmentation: RandomCrop, Flip, Rotation

## Folder Structure
- `cnn/`: PyTorch code for CNN experiments
- `traditional_cv/`: SIFT/Harris + SVM code
- `figures/`: Accuracy and loss figures
- `resnet18/`: pretrained Resnet18 + Optuna

## Learnings
- Dataset size had greater impact than resolution on CNN
- Traditional CV performed better on high-res small datasets
- Using Harris keypoints before SIFT improved performance on CIFAR-10, despite its lower resolution, by reducing noise and focusing feature extraction.
- While ResNet18 yielded the best results among tested models, its high parameter count resulted in noticeable overfitting. Regularization and pretraining were critical to its success.
